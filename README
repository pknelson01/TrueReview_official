Michaels App Idea (True Review...?):
    - Big Movie Database
    - Review is blurred, won't be un-blurred until you have seen the film foryourself and left your own review
    - Social Media-ish (Following Feed, what your friends are watching and friend recommendations)
    - Film Verification, validate that you did indeed watch the film so you are allowed to review the film based on your genuine, bias free, opinion.
    - Badge System
    - Movie Poster, date & time, photo attachment (group you watched with or movie ticket), secondary reviews after the hype is over
    - Snap Score type of feature
    - Titles for certain events (i.e. "May the Force be with you." for watching star wars opening night)
    - Link to streaming services and a "To be reviewed..." feature where episodes you watched go to a queue where you review
